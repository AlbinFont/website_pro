Welcome to my professional website.

My professional interests concern vector-borne diseases. More specifically, I am studying dynamic traits related to mosquito vectors biology and interaction dynamics between mosquito-borne pathogens and their hosts. My studies include the estimation of extrinsic and intrinsic incubation period distributions and how they influence vector competence and vector-borne disease outbreak in the field.  

My other interest is to elucidate if a trait related to vector-borne diseases has a genetic basis, and if it does, discover the genetic factors underlying it. 

I am open to explore within and beyond these frontiers through collaborations :smiley: :rocket:
