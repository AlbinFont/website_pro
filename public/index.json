Both infected humans and other extra-terrestrial life forms experience fever, severe headaches, skin rash and mild bleeding symptoms. The FIRST ORDER has sent health experts in the area. They identified the causing agent as being a vector-borne virus transmitted by an autochthonous mosquito species. Estimating the virus incubation period in vertebrate hosts would help to determine the duration of the containment measure to control the outbreak. We will see here how to estimate an incubation period distribution in veterbrate hosts for a vector-borne pathogen. Vector-borne pathogens have a transmission cycle that involve invertebrate hosts (called the vector, i.e. mosquitoes, ticks, phlebotomes…) and vertebrate hosts (i.e., human or here extra-terrestrial :). We will assume here that virus acquisition by the vertebrate host can only be due to an infectious mosquito bites. Incubation period (IP) is defined here as the time elapsed from virus acquisition to onset of symptoms in vertebrate host. We will only focus on symptomatic infection here. Estimating the duration of IP in vertebrate hosts is not straightforward for vector-borne pathogens because date of infection through the bite of an infectious vector cannot usually be determined. People are usually bitten all the time by insects and they cannot trace back an infectious bite in time. We will exploit here declared travel and symptom dates of travelers entering or leaving areas with ongoing virus transmission with interval-censored time to event (survival) analyses.\nThis code was used for the paper “Variability of Zika Virus Incubation Period in Humans” (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30397624).\n  Load packages You will need these packages.\nlibrary(msm) library(survival) library(plyr) library(ggplot2) library(lubridate) library(interval) library(icenReg) #library(survminer) #Survminer is a nice package to visualize non-parametric survival curves. But I could\u0026#39;nt make it work on interval censored data.  Generate data I generate a data.frame here. The first column of the data.frame is patient IDs, the second column indicates if they belong to the human race (Human=yes or no), the third column (Arrival) indicates the declared date of arrival in Naboo, the planet with active virus transmission. The last column indicates the duration of the stay in Naboo. All patients are travelers that visited the planet for a short period. There is no reported active virus transmission elsewhere in the galaxies. I generate a declared symptom onset date based on the date of arrival + a random number in the interval [1 ; Length_of_stay-1] + a incubation period drawn from a truncated (null or negative values not allowed) normal distribution, i.e. N(mean, SD=4). The mean for each patient category is indicated below.\nset.seed(12) Mean_ip_human \u0026lt;- 6 # Mean incubation period in human Mean_ip_alien \u0026lt;- 12 # Mean incubation period in alien data \u0026lt;- data.frame(ID=seq(1,194,1), Name=c(paste(\u0026quot;Wookie\u0026quot;,1:14, sep=\u0026quot;_\u0026quot;),paste(\u0026quot;Ewok\u0026quot;,1:50, sep=\u0026quot;_\u0026quot;), paste(\u0026quot;Stormtrooper\u0026quot;,1:70, sep=\u0026quot;_\u0026quot;), paste(\u0026quot;Snowtrooper\u0026quot;,1:60,sep=\u0026quot;_\u0026quot;)), Human=c(rep(\u0026quot;no\u0026quot;,64), rep(\u0026quot;yes\u0026quot;,70+60)) , Arrival=sample(seq(as.Date(\u0026quot;2016/01/01\u0026quot;), as.Date(\u0026quot;2018/01/01\u0026quot;), by=\u0026quot;day\u0026quot;), 194) , Length_of_stay_declared_days= round(rtnorm(194, mean = 15, sd = 4, lower=1))) data\u0026lt;- ddply(data, .(ID), mutate, Symptoms= if(Human==\u0026quot;no\u0026quot;) {Arrival + sample(x = 1:(Length_of_stay_declared_days-1), 1) + round(rtnorm(1, mean = Mean_ip_alien, sd = 5, lower=1))}else{Arrival + sample(x = 1:(Length_of_stay_declared_days-1), 1) + round(rtnorm(1, mean = Mean_ip_human, sd = 5, lower=1))}) We use the lubridate package to convert dates:\ndata$Arrival \u0026lt;- ymd(as.character(data$Arrival)) #lubridate data$Symptoms \u0026lt;- ymd(as.character(data$Symptoms )) #lubridate Lets denote A for the date of Arrival in the zone of transmission (planet Naboo), D for date of Departure from planet Naboo and S for the date of Symptom declaration.\nAccording to these terms we can calculate the following parameters:\n Duration of the stay in Naboo (Time_A_D)= D - A Duration from departure from Naboo and symptom onset (Time_D_S) = S - D Duration from arrival in Naboo and symptom onsets (Time_A_S) = S - A  We also use the lubridate package to calculate the day of departure from the day of arrival and the period of stay in the zone of active transmission.\ndata \u0026lt;- ddply(data, .(ID), mutate, Departure= Arrival + Length_of_stay_declared_days, Time_D_S= interval(Departure, Symptoms) %/% days(), Time_A_D= interval(Arrival,Departure ) %/% days(), Time_A_S= Time_A_D+Time_D_S) data \u0026lt;- arrange(data, desc(Time_A_D)) data$ID \u0026lt;- factor(data$ID, levels=data$ID ) We can represent the travel data graphically:\np \u0026lt;- ggplot(data=data) p \u0026lt;- p + geom_vline(xintercept = 0, color = \u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, size=1 ) p \u0026lt;- p + geom_segment(aes(x = -Time_A_S , y = factor(ID), xend = -Time_D_S, yend = factor(ID), color=Human)) p \u0026lt;- p + geom_point(aes(x = -Time_A_S, y = factor(ID)), size = 2, color = \u0026quot;orange\u0026quot;) p \u0026lt;- p + geom_point(aes(x = -Time_D_S, y = factor(ID)), size = 2, color = \u0026quot;forestgreen\u0026quot;) p \u0026lt;- p + theme_bw(base_size = 20) p \u0026lt;- p + theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), panel.grid.major = element_blank(), axis.text.y=element_blank(), axis.ticks.y=element_blank()) #p \u0026lt;- p + facet_wrap(~Human, scales = \u0026quot;free_y\u0026quot;, nrow=2) p \u0026lt;- p + ggtitle(\u0026quot;\u0026quot;) + ylab(\u0026quot;Individuals\u0026quot;) p \u0026lt;- p + scale_color_manual(values = c(\u0026quot;dodgerblue3\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;deeppink2\u0026quot;)) p \u0026lt;- p + scale_x_continuous(name=\u0026quot;Time (days)\u0026quot;, limits=c(-100,30), breaks=seq(-100,30,10)) p The vertical black line represents the onset of symptoms. Travel data from human and not human patients are represented with colored horizontal lines. The arrival and departure from the area with ongoing virus transmission is represented with an orange and green dot, respectively.\nThe exposure interval is delineated by the arrival date and the departure date for travelers that experienced symptoms after returning from travel, whereas the period separating the arrival date and the symptom onset date delineated the exposure interval in travelers experiencing illness during the journey.\nWe can thus define the exposure interval with 2 different manners. Concerning patients experiencing symptoms after departure from endemic zone: exposure interval = Time_A_D Concerning patients experiencing symptoms during the trip: exposure interval = Time_A_S\nI am creating the interval censored data (Surv object) conditionally:\ndata$left \u0026lt;- NA data$right \u0026lt;- data$Time_A_S for(i in 1:nrow(data)) { if(data[i,\u0026quot;Time_D_S\u0026quot;] \u0026lt; 0) {data[i,\u0026quot;left\u0026quot;] \u0026lt;- 0}else{data[i,\u0026quot;left\u0026quot;] \u0026lt;- data[i,\u0026quot;Time_D_S\u0026quot;]} } temp \u0026lt;- with(data, Surv(left,right,type=\u0026quot;interval2\u0026quot;))  Non-parametric model I first use non-parametric time to event model, which are the most robust (no bias related to mispecification of the hazard distribution).

Estimates are calculated over a set of time intervals called Turnbull intervals, which represent the innermost intervals over a group of individuals in which NPMLE can change. Median survival estimates correspond to the time where the survival probability reaches 0.5 (gold horizontal line).\nThe median IP occured during the interval [6;7] for humans and [11;12] for extra-terrestrials. That correspond to mean values that we have setted up previously :smiley:.\nWe can apply some statistical tests (non-parametric log-rank tests) implemented in the interval package:\n#logrank: Sun\u0026#39;s scores test\u0026lt;-ictest(temp~Human, data=data) test #logrank: Finkelstein\u0026#39;s scores test\u0026lt;-ictest(temp~Human, data=data, scores=\u0026quot;logrank2\u0026quot;) test #Wilcoxon-type tests test\u0026lt;-ictest(temp~Human, data=data, scores=\u0026quot;wmw\u0026quot;) test #Wilcoxon-type tests, exact Monte Carlo test\u0026lt;-ictest(temp~Human, data=data, scores=\u0026quot;wmw\u0026quot;, exact=T) test Patient category is significantly impacting the duration of virus incubation.\n Parametric model (accelerated failure-time regression model (AFT)) We now are going to model the incubation period distribution using parametric models (accelerated failure-time regression models (AFT).\nFully parametric models provide more efficient inference and quantification of uncertainty of time to event estimates (smoother probability distribution with restricted confidence intervals) at the cost of requiring a correct assumption of the baseline distribution family. The use of fully parametric models is also convenient because they link a time post virus exposure to a probability of symptom onset through an equation with estimated parameters.\nWe first have to determine the baseline function.\ndiag_baseline(temp ~ 1, model = \u0026quot;ph\u0026quot;, data = data, dists = c(\u0026quot;exponential\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;weibull\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;loglogistic\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;gamma\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;lnorm\u0026quot;), lgdLocation = \u0026quot;topright\u0026quot;) I choose the loglogistic baseline distribution. We will now use the icenReg package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/icenReg/vignettes/icenReg.pdf).\nfit_loglogistic \u0026lt;- ic_par(temp ~ Human, data = data, model = \u0026quot;aft\u0026quot;, dist = \u0026quot;loglogistic\u0026quot;) summary(fit_loglogistic) newdata\u0026lt;-data.frame(Human=levels(data$Human)) rownames(newdata) \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;Not human\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Human\u0026quot;) survCIs(fit_loglogistic, p=0.5, newdata = newdata) #Median estimates survCIs(fit_loglogistic, p=0.95, newdata = newdata) #95th centiles estimates plot(fit_loglogistic, newdata = newdata, fun = \u0026quot;cdf\u0026quot;) abline(h=0.5, col=\u0026quot;gold3\u0026quot;) The plot displays parametric estimates of virus incubation period probabilities over time.\nThe median estimates are 11.2 days and 6.4 days for aliens and human, respectively.\n Bayesian accelerated failure-time regression model (AFT): The icenReg R package dedicated to interval censored data offers the opportunity to extend fully parametric models to the Bayesian framework. In this case, Bayesian inference is used to estimate the log-logistic baseline distribution parameters (shape and scale) instead of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).\nWe will use flat priors here.

The time interval between virus acquisition and transmission by the vector, termed extrinsic incubation period (EIP), combines with vector mortality rate and vector competence to determine the proportion of infected vectors that eventually become infectious. However, the dynamic nature of this process, and the amount of natural variation in transmission kinetics among arbovirus strains, are poorly documented empirically and are rarely considered in epidemiological models. Here, we combine newly generated empirical measurements in vivo and outbreak simulations in silico to assess the epidemiological significance of genetic variation in dengue virus (DENV) transmission kinetics by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. We found significant variation in the dynamics of systemic mosquito infection, a proxy for EIP, among eight field-derived DENV isolates representing the worldwide diversity of recently circulating type 1 strains. Using a stochastic agent-based model to compute time-dependent individual transmission probabilities, we predict that the observed variation in systemic mosquito infection kinetics may drive significant differences in the probability of dengue outbreak and the number of human infections. Our results demonstrate that infection dynamics in mosquitoes vary among wild-type DENV isolates and that this variation potentially affects the risk and magnitude of dengue outbreaks. Our quantitative assessment of DENV genetic variation in transmission kinetics contributes to improve our understanding of heterogeneities in arbovirus epidemiological dynamics.","tags":["Aedes aegypti","DENV","Vector competence dynamic","extrinsic incubation period","agent based model"],"title":"Epidemiological significance of dengue virus genetic variation in mosquito infection dynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fontaine Albin","Filipovic Igor","Fansiri Thanyalak","Hoffmann Ary","Cheng Changde","Kirkpatrick Mark","Rasic Gordana","Lambrechts Louis"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1504216800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504216800,"objectID":"c3cd0c50841edf3a8a8f66e46984e3e3","permalink":"/publication/gbe_extensive/","publishdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/gbe_extensive/","section":"publication","summary":"Mechanisms and evolutionary dynamics of sex-determination systems are of particular interest in insect vectors of human pathogens like mosquitoes because novel control strategies aim to convert pathogen-transmitting females into nonbiting males, or rely on accurate sexing for the release of sterile males. In Aedes aegypti, the main vector of dengue and Zika viruses, sex determination is governed by a dominant male-determining locus, previously thought to reside within a small, nonrecombining, sex-determining region (SDR) of an otherwise homomorphic sex chromosome. Here, we provide evidence that sex chromosomes in Ae. aegypti are genetically differentiated between males and females over a region much larger than the SDR. Our linkage mapping intercrosses failed to detect recombination between X and Y chromosomes over a 123-Mbp region (40% of their physical length) containing the SDR. This region of reduced male recombination overlapped with a smaller 63-Mbp region (20% of the physical length of the sex chromosomes) displaying high male–female genetic differentiation in unrelated wild populations from Brazil and Australia and in a reference laboratory strain originating from Africa. In addition, the sex-differentiated genomic region was associated with a significant excess of male-to-female heterozygosity and contained a small cluster of loci consistent with Y-specific null alleles. We demonstrate that genetic differentiation between sex chromosomes is sufficient to assign individuals to their correct sex with high accuracy. We also show how data on allele frequency differences between sexes can be used to estimate linkage disequilibrium between loci and the sex-determining locus. Our discovery of large-scale genetic differentiation between sex chromosomes in Ae. aegypti lays a new foundation for mapping and population genomic studies, as well as for mosquito control strategies targeting the sex-determination pathway.","tags":["Aedes aegypti","linkage mapping","sex-determining region"],"title":"Extensive Genetic Differentiation between Homomorphic Sex Chromosomes in the Mosquito Vector, Aedes aegypti","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.\n Slides can be added in a few ways:\n Create slides using Academic\u0026rsquo;s Slides feature and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Upload an existing slide deck to static/ and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Embed your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using shortcodes.

The time interval between acquisition and subsequent transmission of the pathogen, called the extrinsic incubation period, is one of the most influential parameters of vector-borne pathogen transmission. However, the dynamic nature of this process is often ignored because vector competence assays are sacrificial and rely on end-point measurements. Here, we report that individual Aedes aegypti mosquitoes release large amounts of dengue virus (DENV) RNA in their excreta that can be non-sacrificially detected over time following oral virus exposure. Further, we demonstrate that detection of DENV RNA in excreta from individual mosquitoes is correlated to systemic viral dissemination with high specificity (0.9-1) albeit moderate sensitivity (0.64-0.89). Finally, we illustrate the potential of our finding to detect biological differences in the dynamics of DENV dissemination in a proof-of-concept experiment. Individual measurements of the time required for systemic viral dissemination, a prerequisite for transmission, will be valuable to monitor the dynamics of DENV vector competence, to carry out quantitative genetics studies, and to evaluate the risk of DENV transmission in field settings.","tags":["extrinsic incubation period","arbovirus","DENV"],"title":"Excretion of dengue virus RNA by Aedes aegypti allows non-destructive monitoring of viral dissemination in individual mosquitoes","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461708000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461708000,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

Such specificity challenges our current understanding of invertebrate defenses against pathogens because it contrasts the limited discriminatory power of known invertebrate immune responses. Lack of a mechanistic explanation, however, has questioned the nature of host factors underlying G×G interactions. In this study, we aimed to determine whether G×G interactions observed between dengue viruses and their Aedes aegypti vectors in nature can be mapped to discrete loci in the mosquito genome and to document their genetic architecture. We developed an innovative genetic mapping strategy to survey G×G interactions using outbred mosquito families that were experimentally exposed to genetically distinct isolates of two dengue virus serotypes derived from human patients. Genetic loci associated with vector competence indices were detected in multiple regions of the mosquito genome. Importantly, correlation between genotype and phenotype was virus isolate-specific at several of these loci, indicating G×G interactions. The relatively high percentage of phenotypic variation explained by the markers associated with G×G interactions (ranging from 7.8% to 16.5%) is consistent with large-effect host genetic factors. Our data demonstrate that G×G interactions between dengue viruses and mosquito vectors can be assigned to physical regions of the mosquito genome, some of which have a large effect on the phenotype. This finding establishes the existence of tangible host genetic factors underlying specific interactions between invertebrates and their pathogens in a natural system. Fine mapping of the uncovered genetic loci will elucidate the molecular mechanisms of mosquito-virus specificity.","tags":["G×G interactions","arbovirus","DENV","Aedes aegypti","genetic mapping"],"title":"Genetic mapping of specific interactions between Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and dengue viruses","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Albin Fontaine","Ibrahima Diouf","Nawal Bakkali","Dorothée Missé","Frédéric Pagès","Thierry Fusai","Christophe Rogier","Lionel Almeras"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1322694000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1322694000,"objectID":"ec937fdc2cab2ef600b306150cbed839","permalink":"/publication/pv_review/","publishdate":"2011-12-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pv_review/","section":"publication","summary":"The saliva of haematophagous arthropods contains an array of anti-haemostatic, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory molecules that contribute to the success of the blood meal.
